## Problem

Meeting new people, finding hidden gems, or picking activities can all be tricky when traveling to new places, especially when traveling alone or in small groups. Many people often find themselves going to TripAdvisor and typing in “Top 10 Things to Do In …” only to be met with over-priced tours, tourist-driven sights, and out-dated information. Traditionally, many people hope to find friends when staying in hostels or simply on the street – but we can’t leave everything to chance. This is certainly an issue for frequent travelers looking for ways to quickly find new groups of people with similar interests who want to explore together. 

Adventurista hopes to solve all these problems and more: imagine that when you travel, you can see on any given day what events are popular or where everyone your age is going for the night. This social platform is essentially facebook group meets dating app – it connects people through group events. It allows users to seamlessly plan adventures, browse through other people’s events, join groups, and organize itineraries. 

Adventurista allows users to grow an global network of friends, meet new people, find new places, and plan new adventures.
